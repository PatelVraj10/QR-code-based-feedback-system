# QR-code-based-feedbackform

It is a QR code based feedback form with mobile verification and admin panel.
In admin panel admin can analyse the response of feedback form.

For mobile verification and admin login I have used google firebase!


For storing the data of feedback form I have used php!


You have to create a table and import the sql file into your phpmyadmin..

For firebase you have to create 2 projects 1 for mobile verification and another for admin login..
